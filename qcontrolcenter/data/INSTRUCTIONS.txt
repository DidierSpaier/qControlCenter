*** qControlCenter INSTRUCTIONS ***

STEP 1
------
qControlCenter needs a structure to work, containing one directory per category, fed with .desktop files.

The main directory searched for by qControlCenter is ~/.qcontrolcenter and if not found /etc/skel/.qcontrolcenter. If none is found it displays these instructions.

In this document ~ represents a user's home directory e.g. /home/didier.

Upon an account creation, if a directory /etc/skel/.qcontrolcenter exists it will be copied as ~/.qcontrolcenter.

So: 

If you are a sysadmin or distribution maintainer, we suggest that you store the structure in /etc/skel/.qcontrolcenter.

If you are an end user and already have a ~/.qcontrolcenter directory, you can use it as is and also customize it to your liking.

If you are an end user with no existing ~/.qcontrolcenter directory, you will implicitly use the global /etc/skel/.qcontrolcenter directory.
But you can also copy it as ~/.qcontrolcenter then customize it or if you are the sole user of your computer just create ~/.qcontrolcenter.

Of course the customization of ~/.qcontrolcenter will only affect the user in concern.

STEP 2
------

Inside the folder created above, the sysadmin (the end user in case of a personal computer) creates directories corresponding to the control center categories. Example :
# cd /etc/skel/.qcontrolcenter
or
# cd ~/.qcontrolcenter (in case of just one user account)
# mkdir Hardware
# mkdir Network
# mkdir Security
# mkdir Seetings
# mkdir System
# mkdir Utility


STEP 3
------
Fill these directories with some '.desktop' files. Most of them are usually located in '/usr/share/applications'. You may copy or link the .desktop files in a subdirectory of your choice.
Example :

# cd /etc/.qcontrolcenter/Devices
# ln -s /usr/share/applications/cups.desktop
# ln -s /usr/share/applications/hplip.desktop
# ln -s /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop

You can check the compliance of your .dektop files to the XDG
specification with the command desktop-file-validate.

STEP 4
------
You may create an icon for your section. qControlCenter uses the file
named 'icon.png' in your subdirectory as icon for the section.  example:
~/.qcontrolcenter/Devices/icon.png)


STEP 5
------
You also may want to localize  the sections' names: create a file named 'folder.ini' (example : ~/.qcontrolcenter/Devices/folder.ini) and write it like this :

default=Hardware
fr=Mat√©riel
it=...
de=...
ru=...

qControlCenter detects automatically your language. 'default=' means English.

STEP 6
------
Run qcontrolcenter

NOTES
-----

By default the window's title is QControlCenter.

You can change it setting the QCONTROLCENTERTITLE environment variable before running qcontrolcenter.

qControlCenter takes into account the content of the ShowOnlyIn and NotShowIn fields of the .desktop files.

This can be useful if several desktops are available, to show only the relevant icons for the one in use, set as XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP.
