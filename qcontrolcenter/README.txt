INSTALL:

	# cd qcontrolcenter
	# python qcontrolcenter.py
	or
	# python qcontrolcenter.py /path/to/a/spectific/structure/directory

qControlCenter setup INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------------
	STEP 1
	------
	In order to use qControlCenter you have to create a main structure directory. For instance : 
	
	# mkdir /etc/qcontrolcenter
	
	By default, qControlCenter uses /etc/qcontrolcenter as base structure directory.
	
	
	STEP 2
	------
	Inside the folder created above, create subdirectories corresponding to the control center categories. Example :
	
	# cd /etc/qcontrolcenter
	# mkdir Boot
	# mkdir Devices
	# mkdir NetworkAndInternet
	# mkdir Security
	# mkdir System
	
	
	STEP 3
	------
	You have to fill those directories with some '.desktop' files. Most of them are usually located in '/usr/share/applications'. You may copy or link the .desktop files in a subdirectory of your choice. Example :
	
	# cd /etc/qcontrolcenter/Devices
	# ln -s /usr/share/applications/cups.desktop
	# ln -s /usr/share/applications/hplip.desktop
	# ln -s /usr/share/applications/nvidia-settings.desktop
	
	
	STEP 4
	------
	You may create an icon for your section. qControlCenter uses the file named 'icon.png' in your subdirectory as icon for the section (example : /etc/qcontrolcenter/Devices/icon.png)
	
	
	STEP 5
	------
	You also may want to customize the name of the section in your language. Create a file named 'folder.ini' (example : /etc/qcontrolcenter/Devices/folder.ini) and write it like this :
	
	default=Hardware
	fr=Périphériques
	it=...
	de=...
	ru=...
	
	qControlCenter detects automatically your language.
	Note : 'default=' means english.
